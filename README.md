# Hotel_League

This project is still in development!

The project was created for a Hotel League featuring multiple hotels. The site's owner can register admin level users, who can create a new hotel, upload images, create rooms, modify their own hotels. The site's owner can modify every hotel.

Image uploading works with AWS. Uploaded image data, like the key, id, mime-type gets saved to the room's or hotel's database. Deleting a hotel will delete every image from the AWS Bucket associated with the hotel. 

Future updates:
  -Search functionality

Technologies used:

Please, if you have any questions, feel free to ask, I am more than happy to demo the website for you.
